In tkinter barebones:
Make taskbar out of blue empty rectangles.
The rectangles fill the taskbar.
Introduce type of rectangle that can span rectangles.
Add green rectangle that can span three rectangles on top of them.
Make taskbar width match window width.
Let's number the empty blue rectangles.
Let's make jsonlike object and add 30+ example names of programs.
This jsonlike object is for mapping program names on the empty blue rectangles.
if there is not enough rectangles, two buttons "down" and "up" at the end of blue rectangles should appear, allowing to navigate.
When navigating: pressing down: it should make appear next row of programs. The same amount of visible blue rectangles.
